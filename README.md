# Rock-Paper-Scissors – C++ Console Game

This is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game I built using C++ as a way to practice structuring clean code, working with enums and structs, and building a fun little console application with user interaction.

---

## 🎯 What It Does

The game lets you play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer for up to 10 rounds. After each round, it shows the choices, declares the winner, and keeps score. At the end, it displays a summary of the results, including who won the most rounds and some visual feedback using console colors. You can play as many games as you want in one session.

## 💡 Why I Built It

This project started as a small exercise to get more comfortable with organizing code in C++ using enums, structs, and functions. I wanted to go beyond just a basic implementation and include proper round tracking, win counters, input validation, and a replay feature — all while keeping the code clean and modular. It’s a fun way to practice problem-solving and console UI design.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Random number generation for computer choices  
- Enums to manage game states and choices  
- Structs to organize round data and overall results  
- Functions for clean separation of logic  
- Basic console styling using system colors (Windows)  
- Input validation and replayability

## 👷️‍♂️ How to Use It

Just compile and run the program in any C++-supported environment. It’s built to run in the terminal with simple input/output prompts. You’ll be asked how many rounds you want to play (1 to 10), and the game will take it from there. When the game ends, you can choose to play again.

## 🏗️ Room for Improvement

A few things I might explore adding in the future:
- Better console graphics or ASCII art for the choices  
- File logging for win/loss tracking across sessions  
- Cross-platform color support (Linux/Mac compatibility)  
- Multiplayer mode or user vs. user option  
- A GUI version using a library like SFML or Qt
